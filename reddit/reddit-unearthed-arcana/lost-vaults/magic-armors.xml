            <p>This scary looking armor is composed of a skull helmet, a ribcage breast plate, and forelimb bones for the arms and legs.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wearing this armor, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and no longer require food, water, and sleep.</p>
            <p class="indent">Cursed- You are unable to remove this armor as it binds to the skeleton of the wearer. It can only be removed with a remove curse spell or similar spell. If you die with this armor on, you rise as a skeleton, and attack the nearest creature. While wearing this armor, you count as an undead for terms of turn undead, vulnerabilities, and arcane senses.</p>

            <p>This seemingly normal set of armor phases through walls slightly when touching them, seeming to give a hint to their power.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once per day while wearing this armor when you are against a wall, you can teleport to the other side without requiring line of sight. You cannot teleport if the wall is more than 10 feet thick, or if there is an obstacle in the space you would appear at (Creature or object). If there is an obstacle, you do not teleport, and the power is wasted for the day.</p>
